#Tractor Case Study

An initial study of auction data for tractors over various auctioneer locations proved challenging due to the massive batches of missing data across multiple unified datasets. After some data clean up and reshaping of features, my group thought it best to run some preliminary EDA over all features to see which may be the strongest predictors of future price for a given tractor. Most of the largely empty columns proved to contain some signal but were not particularly strong predictors for tractor price even after conversion to categoricals. 

The presentation provided contains figures showing the largely empty feature data. We found that the most predictive features for the data were the most recent sale price, year made, ModelID (for some highly valued models), product group, machine hours, and "thumb".
